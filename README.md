This was a personal project I built for my wife who is an artist. 

I learned a lot with this project, including:
 * How to use css grid and flex box
 * How to add a css and javascript lightbox to a gallery of images
 * How to write media queries to make the site look great on any device
 * How to link to a CDN to grab icons (fontawesome)
 * How to compress images to improve page loading times
 
I used JavaScript for the mobile nav menu.
